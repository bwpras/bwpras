ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Becks

In this pages im going to write about my project, research, and hobbies. Project and research seems a bit difficult to talk for a starting point, 
so I will try to elaborate more about my hobbies in FPV drone (and because its fun). 

So lets begin with my setup in FPV
- Frame   : IFlight XL 5 from banggood
- FC      : Matek F405 STD with PDB 
- Motor   : Racerstar BR2205 2300kV
- ESC     : FVT Littlebee 30A with Dshot Modded (Dshot300)
- Camera  : Caddx Ratel Starlight
- VTX     : AKK FX2 Ultimate 25/200/600/800 mW with TBS Triumph Pro Antenna
- RX      : ExpressLRS 2.4Ghz EP 1 Receiver
- TX      : Jumper T12 Pro with Express LRS 2.4Ghz Happymodel
- Googles : Eachine EV 800 DM (because it fits with my glasses) with ORT dual shield

Looking to upgrades.. slowly but surely
